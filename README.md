# SimpleControls

An easy way to control script functionality.

SimpleControls is a pip package that contains a the package 'powerful', which actually has two modules: 
'simplify.py' and 'control.py'.

The "SimpleControls": 'powerful' package is easy to use and provides several ways of accessing and manipulating data.

The 'control.py' module contains classes, functions and methods specifically for *calling* and accessing other functions /methods.
While the 'simplify.py' module contains classes, functions and methods for creating, accessing and manipulating objects, types and other data.

These modules allow for the creation, access, and manipulation of objects, functions and types like (str, int etc.)
The modules are basic and anyone could have written them and probally have but,
i wanted to help prevent writting so much code and bombarding the script so,
i wrote them myself.
